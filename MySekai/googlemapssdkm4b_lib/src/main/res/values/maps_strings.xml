    <!-- Data connection lost, retrying... This message is displayed when all
         network connections (2G, 3G, WiFi, ...) are failing and the Street
         View application is retrying, waiting for the connection to work. 2G/3G
         mobile data might be failing due to being outside the coverage area or
         roaming with roaming data disabled.

         This message must be BRIEF. It goes in the title bar along side the
         "Loading" status text and a progress indicator. If the text is too long,
         Android will elide it. Make sure that at least the "connection lost"
         gist of it fits in the first 30 characters.

         Typically the user will have to take some corrective action such as
         turning off airplane mode, enabling WiFi, moving to a different
         location, or else hitting the Back button to exit the application.

         Note the ellipsis character (\\u2026) at the end of the string.

    <!-- Picture no longer available. This string is displayed when a street view
         panorama has been removed. Panoramas are sometimes removed due to
         privacy concerns or inappropriate content. We want to use a generic,
         passive voice phrase like "Picture no longer available".

    <!-- Street View service unavailable. This message is displayed in a street
         view window title when the network load on the street view servers
         is so high that they have to stop responding to user requests.

         This only happens occasionally, perhaps once a year, typically when
         street view is first turned on for a large  new market and a lot of
         people access it all at the same time.

    <!-- No panorama data has been set. This view has been created, but no panorama
         data has been set for it. This error typically indicates a mistake has
         been made in coding the Street View application. It should be very rare in
         practice.
      -->

    <!-- Invalid panorama data. This is an error message that is shown when
         bad panorama data is received from the Street View server. It should be
         very rare in practice.

    <!-- The abbreviations for the 8 compass directions in clockwise order from North.

         These abbreviations appear surrounded with parentheses and appended
         to the street name on the "yellow lines" that display road directions
         in the street view panorama view. For example "Embarcadero (SE)"

    <!-- Used to format a street address. This string is passed to String.format().
         Argument 1 is the street-range as a string, example "123"
         Argument 2 is the street name as a string, example "Main Street"
         Typically this format is either "%1$s %2$s" for USA style 123 Main Street
         or "%2$s %1$s" for French/Spanish style "Main Street 123".

    <!-- Network unavailable. This "toast" message is displayed when the data
         network is unavailable, e.g. the phone is out of the mobile network's
         coverage area, the phone is roaming but roaming data has been disabled,
         or the phone's radios are turned off e.g. for airplane mode. The message
         suggests possible causes to repair. -->
