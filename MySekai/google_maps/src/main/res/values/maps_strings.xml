   <!-- Data connection lost, retrying... This message is displayed when all

        View application is retrying, waiting for the connection to work. 2G/3G
        mobile data might be failing due to being outside the coverage area or
        roaming with roaming data disabled.

        This message must be BRIEF. It goes in the title bar along side the
        "Loading" status text and a progress indicator. If the text is too long,
        Android will elide it. Make sure that at least the "connection lost"
        gist of it fits in the first 30 characters.

        Typically the user will have to take some corrective action such as
        turning off airplane mode, enabling WiFi, moving to a different
        location, or else hitting the Back button to exit the application.

        Note the ellipsis character (\\u2026) at the end of the string.
